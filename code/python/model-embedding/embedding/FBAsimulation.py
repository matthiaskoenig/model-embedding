FBA simulations with the HepatoCore model.
Necessary to add the constraints for the simulations, i.e.

* irreversibilities (flux bounds)
* Delta G values
* additional constraints, i.e. exchange sets (which components do not have to be balanced)

Use CobraPy and CBMPy for simple simulations of the network.
